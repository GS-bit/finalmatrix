# Finalmatrix
A program to find the final matrix using the Gauss-Jordan linear equations resolution method.

In mathematics, there are some methods to solve linear equations, and the Gauss-Jordan is one very popular, in which the goal is, using elementary operations, to try to transform, the closest possible, the matrix of the coefficients into the identity matrix, while the matrix of the independent terms will suffer these same elementary operations. Thereafter, it will be possible to get easily the solutions of the system.

In this program, the user will inform the order of the system of linear equations, for example 3, so he may give, afterwards, 9 values of coefficients: 3 for the first variable, 3 for the second and 3 for the third, plus 3 independent terms for each equation. Next, he clicks on the "Calculate" button and the program will perform some elementary operations, transforming all the data into the final matrix, that which is possible to get easily the solutions of the system.
